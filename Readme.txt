	Installation instructions

		
	If you wish to install the BandMates application on your desktop or 			laptop, please go through the following steps.


	Step 1: Accessing GitHub

	. Go to https://github.com/ and sign in to your account
 	
	. If you do not have a GitHub account, click the "Sign up for GitHub" 	  	  button on the landing page. Once the account creation process has been 	  completed, you are ready to proceed to the second step.

	
	Step 2: Locating the files to download 

	. Once you are signed in to GitHub, in the search bar located to the 	  	  left of the "Pull requests" tab (found on the navigation links) type 	  	  in "s3722979/Bandmates". This is the repository where the files are 			  located.


	Step 3: Downloading the ZIP file

	. Once you have reached the repository page, you should see a green 	  	  button labelled "Code". 

	. You will need to click on this button and then a drop-down menu will 	  	  appear. Select the "Download ZIP" option. 

	. Once you have downloaded the ZIP folder containing the source code, 	  	  you are ready to proceed to the next step.



	Step 4: Installing a SFTP client program

	. Firstly, ensure that you have a SFTP (secure file transfer 	  	  	  protocol) program installed on your computer. For example, "WinSCP" 	  	  for Windows OS. Alternatively, "Cyberduck" is available for Mac OS.

	. This SFTP client is very useful as it allows you to transfer files 	  	  between a local computer (e.g. your desktop/laptop) and a remote 	  	  computer (e.g. RMIT titan server)


	Step 5: Accessing the titan servers (using WinSCP in this example)

	. Once you have installed WinSCP/Cyberduck, click on the program to 	  	  launch it.

	. Once it has loaded up, you should see a page that has some details 	  	  which need to be filled in. This includes host name, username and 	  	  password.

	. Ensure the file protocol is set to "SFTP" and port number is set to 	  	  "22". This is to ensure secure file transfer and a secure connection 	  	  to the RMIT titan servers.

	. For the host name, type in "titan.csit.rmit.edu.au"

	. For the login details (Username and Password), enter your username and 	  password that you normally use to access canvas dashboard for RMIT.

 	  

	Step 6: Putting the files onto the titan server

	. Once you are logged in, you will see that within the application, the 	  	  screen is split into two panels. The left side is the local computer 	  (e.g. your PC/laptop) and the right side is the remote server (e.g. 	  RMIT titan server).

	. You will need to transfer the ZIP file you downloaded earlier (in Step 	  3) onto the titan server. 

	. This can be simply done by "dragging and dropping" the ZIP file from 	  	  the left side (your local PC/laptop) to the right side (remote 	  server).

 	  	  

	Step 7: Ready to go

	. Once you have transferred the files to the remote server, you are all 	  	  ready to go. You can now access the BandMates web application via the 	  	  URL "http://titan.csit.rmit.edu.au/~s1234567/bandmates/index.php"

	. Note, ensure that where it says "1234567" you put your unique RMIT 	  	  student number!
